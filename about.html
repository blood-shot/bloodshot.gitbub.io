<p >  This page showcases my 
graphic design work such as photography, food photography and typography. 
I am currently studying a Communication Design course at Federation University.
My greatest passion in life is cooking, I have incorporated this love with my 
second love with is photography, and tried to capture true raw looking food. 
My goal is to find work in a food magazine one day. I have chosen graphic 
design as my pathway, because I am not really a talkative person... I find 
it very hard to talk therefore my way of speaking how I feel is though a 
visual way. ----- more ------- It's your friendly neighbourhood Jason Blood, this page showcases my
